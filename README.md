## Summary:
Arvato Financial Solutions which is a Bertelsmann subsidiary provided the data and outline of this project for the second term of  Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program. The ending goal of the project is to increase the efficiency of the customer acquisition process of a mail-order company.

There are three significant parts of the project:

- 1.**Customer Segmentation Report**:  In this section, I used unsupervised  learning technics to identify clusters in the German population and see how customers of a mail-order company map to them to identify potential customers of the company in Germany.
- 2.**Supervised Learning Model**:  In this section, I  used data from targets of a mail order campaign to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not an individual will respond to an advertising campaign of the company.
- 3.**Kaggle Competition** : Once I've chosen a model, I use it to make predictions on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition.
